# Supermassive-Black-Hole-Gas-and-Dark-Matter-Infall-Dynamics-code
We study black hole growth in a dwarfâ€“galaxy. The dark-matter halo is described by an NFW distribution. We use N-particle simulation for dark matter and for Gas dynamics we use 1D Lagrangian shell scheme (spherical symmetry) solving the Euler equations for an ideal, adiabatic fluid.
